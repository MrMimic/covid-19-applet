During the Covid-19 global pandemic, **Kaggle called for projects answering to different tasks** to perform on a **dataset of Covid-related scientific publications**.

Atos constructed a group of engineers working on **machine learning and applications development fields** in order to provide solutions for this project.

The development started on Kaggle around **mid-April** and ended with this web application.

---------------------------------

This application relies on a **developed Python library** which was originally built to be run on a |kaggle_kernel|.

Our goal was to **overcomes the problem of quickly finding different opinions about a given subjet**. In fact, it can be very difficult to quickly get reliable information: many different points of view are represented in the medias as well as in the scientific litterature.

Instead of simply returning the most closest sentences to the query, we chose to **extract the diferent opinions**, which can be shared by the different groups of people working on a subject.
